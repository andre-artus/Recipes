# Rusks - Buttermilk

## Ingredients
* 1 kg Selfraising Flour (I prefer to use this below: )
or
* 1 kg Cake flour + 8 tsp Baking powder 

* 250 g Butter 
* 1/2 tsp Salt (half tsp)

* 2 eggs
* 200 g Sugar  (1 cup)

* 500 ml Buttermilk rinse container with another 50 ml milk. (If dough too stiff no harm to add an extra bit of milk. It's rather like a soft bread dough)

## Directions

Heat oven to 180°C/170°C Fan oven

1. Rub cold butter into dry ingredients (excluding sugar) until it resembles course mealiemeal.  
2. Add eggs and sugar to buttermilk and beat lightly
3. Pour  into flour mixture and mix until incorporated.  
4. Divide into 2 well greased  square baking pans line the bottom with baking paper. 
5. Cover very lightly with foil (so that u can remove foil easily when it's hot.) Place shiny side towards the dough.
6. Bake for 15 mins  remove foil.
7. Bake further 50mins to one hour. Alternate pans halfway through baking process. Test to see if baked through. Let cool on cooling racks.  
8. Cut into desired size.
9. Lay out on flat  baking sheets dry at 90°C. Keep turning rusks to enable wet sides to dry out too.
10. Enjoy
