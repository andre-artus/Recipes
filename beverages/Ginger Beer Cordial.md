# Ginger Beer Cordial


## Ingredients:
* 700g ginger root (peeled and finely grated)
* 1.5L water
* 1kg sugar (adjust based on your sweetness preference)
* 2-3 lemons (juiced)
* 1-2 teaspoons cream of tartar (optional, for preserving the cordial)

### Optional flavor enhancers:
* cloves, 
* cinnamon sticks, or 
* cardamom 


## Directions
1. Prepare the Ginger:
	- Peel the ginger root and finely grate it using a grater or food processor.
2. Boil the Base:
	- In a large pot, combine the grated ginger, water, and any optional spices you choose.
	- Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for 20-30 minutes. This extracts the flavor from the ginger.
3. Add Sugar and Lemon Juice:
	- Stir in the sugar until fully dissolved.
	- Add the lemon juice to the mixture and let it simmer for another 10 minutes.
4. Strain the Mixture:
	- Remove the pot from heat and let the mixture cool slightly.
	- Strain the liquid through a fine mesh sieve or cheesecloth into a clean bowl, pressing the ginger pulp to extract as much liquid as possible.
5. Optional: Add Cream of Tartar:
	- If you want the cordial to last longer in the fridge, dissolve cream of tartar into the strained liquid while itâ€™s still warm.
6. Bottle the Cordial:
	- Pour the strained cordial into sterilized glass bottles or jars while still warm.
	- Seal the bottles tightly and store them in the fridge. The cordial should keep for several weeks.
	
## Using the Cordial for Ginger Beer:
When ready to make ginger beer:

1. Dilute the Cordial: 
	- Mix 1 part cordial with 4 parts water (or adjust to taste).
2. Add Yeast: 
	- Add a small pinch of active dry yeast to the diluted mixture if you want carbonation. 
	- Let it ferment in a sealed bottle for 1-2 days at room temperature. 
	- Check the pressure periodically to avoid overcarbonation.
3. Refrigerate:
	- Once fizzy, transfer to the fridge to slow fermentation. 
	- Serve chilled.
