# Lemon and Honey Cordial


## Ingredients:
* 6-8 large lemons (for about 300-400ml of juice)
* Lemon zest (from 1-2 lemons)
* 500g honey (adjust to your sweetness preference)
* 1L water

### Optional flavor enhancers:
* A few sprigs of fresh thyme, rosemary, lemon balm, or mint (about 10-15 leaves)


## Directions
1. Prepare the Lemons:
 	- Wash the lemons thoroughly, especially if using the zest.
	- Zest 1-2 lemons and set aside.
	- Juice the lemons until you have about 300-400ml of juice.
2. Boil the Water and Honey:
	- In a large pot, bring the water to a boil.
	- Reduce the heat to low, then add the honey, stirring until fully dissolved.
3. Infuse the Zest (Optional):
	- If using lemon zest or herbs, add them to the honey-water mixture.
	- Simmer gently for 10-15 minutes to infuse the flavors.
4. Add Lemon Juice:
	- Remove the pot from heat and allow it to cool slightly (to preserve the freshness of the lemon juice).
	- Stir in the freshly squeezed lemon juice.
5. Strain the Mixture:
	- Strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve or cheesecloth into a clean bowl or jug. This removes the zest or herbs, leaving a smooth cordial.
6. Bottle the Cordial:
	- Pour the strained cordial into sterilized glass bottles or jars while still warm.
	- Seal tightly and store in the fridge. The cordial should keep for 2-3 weeks.

* As a mixer: Use the cordial in cocktails or mocktails for a citrusy, honeyed twist.
