# Portuguese Rolls (Papo Secos)

## Test 1
* 180g  warm water
* 140g  milk
* 20g  butter
* 7g  dried yeast
* 7g  sugar
* 500g  bread flour
* 7g  salt




## Variant 1

### Ingredients
* 180g  warm water
* 140g  milk
* 20g  butter
* 7g  dried yeast
* 7g  sugar
* 500g  bread flour
* 7g  salt


### Method
1. Add the milk, water, sugar and yeast to your mixing bowl and let stand for 5 minutes for the the yeast to activate.
2. Add flour, butter and salt and mix in your stand mixer for 5 to 10 minutes until you have a soft dough. This dough is going to have a smoother softer texture than normal bread dough because of the addition of milk and butter.
3. Tip dough out into a oiled bowl and cover with cling film or a clean tea towel. Let stand in a warm spot for 1 hour.
4. After 1 hour split dough into 12 equal peices and roll them into balls. Pinch each side for that traditional look and place them on to a lined baking sheet.
5. Slash each piece of dough with a sharp knife and cover with a clean tea towel for another hour. Meanwhile pre-heat the oven to 375 degrees f (190 degrees c).
6. Once rolls have doubled in size sprinkle with flour and bake in the centre of the oven for 15 to 20 minutes until brown.
7. Transfer to a cooling rack. Best served warm or cool completely for storage.

## Variant 2

### Ingredients
* 500 	g 	Cake flour ( 4 x 250 ml / 4 cups )
* 7 	ml 	Salt ( 1½ tsp )
* 10 	g 	Anchor Instant Yeast ( 1 packet )
* 315 	ml 	Lukewarm water ( ± 1¼ cups )


### Method

1. Mix the cake flour and salt together and add Anchor Instant Yeast and mix.
2. Add the lukewarm water to the flour mixture to form a soft dough and knead the dough until smooth and elastic, for about 10 minutes.
3. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface, cover with greased plastic and leave to rest for 5 minutes.
4. Knock the dough down, divide the dough into 12 equal pieces and roll each piece into a ball. Cover with lightly grease plastic and allow to rest for 10 minutes.
5. Dust the table surface with flour. Place a ball onto the floured surface and dust flour on top. With the side of a hand, press down over the middle of the dough, making sure to press all the way to the table surface.
6. Transfer to a flour free surface to roll the knobs at the ends. Place small fingers about 10 mm on each side of the split loaf and roll forward and backward, pressing lightly to divide the dough and forming the rounded knobs on the end of the roll. 
7. Dust well with flour.
8. Place the rolls onto a lightly floured baking tray, cover with greased plastic and rise in a warm place for 15 – 20 minutes.
9. Place an ovenproof dish, with water, into the oven – standing it on the bottom of the oven. Baking whilst steam is circulating in the oven will ensure a soft inside texture and a crispy outer crust.
10. Bake in a preheated oven 200 °C / 400 °F for 15 – 20 minutes until golden brown and crisp

## Variant 3

### Ingredients

#### For activating the yeast

* 1/2 cup lukewarm water (105°F to 110°F | 41°C to 43°C)
* 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
* 1 tablespoon granulated sugar

#### For the bread

* 5 cups bread flour plus up to 3 tablespoons more, if needed
* 1 1/2 cups lukewarm water (105°F to 110°F | 41°C to 43°C)
* 1 tablespoon table salt
* 2 tablespoons salted or unsalted butter
* Cornmeal

### Method

#### Activate the yeast

    In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, mix the water, yeast, and sugar on low speed until combined. Let sit for 10 minutes until foamy.

#### Make the bread

    Add the flour, water, and butter and stir on low until the ingredients are combined and a cohesive dough forms, 3 minutes. Cover with plastic and let sit for 30 minutes.
    Sprinkle the salt over the top of the dough and mix on low (speed 2) for 5 minutes. If the dough rides up the hook, use a spatula to scrape it down.
    Bump the mixer to medium-high (speed 7) and knead for 2 minutes more. The dough should pull away from the sides of the bowl and be slightly sticky. If the dough hasn’t released from the bottom of the bowl, add some more flour—a tablespoon at a time—until it does.
    Remove the bowl from the mixer, cover it with plastic wrap, and place in a warm (68°F to 72°F | 20°C to 22°C), draft-free spot. The inside of your oven with the light turned on is ideal. Let the dough double in size, about 1 hour.

    ☞TESTER TIP: If you’ve always found it tricky to assess when exactly dough has doubled in size, lightly butter a plastic bread proofing bucket or clear glass bowl. Use a grease pencil or piece of tape to mark the level of the dough when you start. Makes it a lot more obvious when the dough has doubled.
    Reach down 1 side of the bowl and gently but firmly pull the dough up and fold it over itself. Don’t punch it down. Rotate the bowl a quarter turn and repeat. Continue turning and folding 2 more times. Cover and let rest until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.
    Repeat the turning and folding process, cover with plastic, and let the dough rest until doubled in size, about 30 minutes more.

#### Shape the dough

    Divide the dough into ten equal pieces, about 4 1/4 ounces (120 grams) each. Lightly flour your hands. Cup one hand over a chunk of dough and roll it on your work surface in a circle to tighten the ball. Being somewhat neurotic, I count the turns—no fewer and no more than 40 revolutions. Repeat with the remaining dough.

    Place the balls on a baking sheet lined with a floured non-terrycloth kitchen towel or a baker’s couche. Cover them with a kitchen towel. Let rest for 20 minutes.

    Transfer the balls to your work surface. Heavily dust the towel again.
    Flour your hands. Flatten a dough ball into a 6-inch (15-cm) disc. Using the side of your hand, make a deep crease (think karate chop) across the middle of the disc.

    Grab both ends of the crease and gently tug them to elongate the dough into a slight oval.
    Fold one half of the dough over the other along the crease. The dough will have a half-moon shape.
    Twist the ends of the half-moon into fat points and, using your thumbs, flatten them a bit to seal.
    Gently transfer the papo seco to the towel, seam-side down. As you shape more rolls, arrange them in a row, few inches apart. Pull the towel up between each row to create a ridge that will hold the shape of the rolls during proofing. Repeat the shaping and lining up the papo-secos, folding up the towel between rows.

#### Bake the papo secos

    Meanwhile, position a rack in the middle of the oven and slip in a baking stone or tiles. Place an empty metal tray on any rack that won’t interfere with the rising papo secos. (Do not use a glass pan as it could shatter.) Crank the heat to 500°F (260°C). The oven and stone will need time to properly heat.
    Have a cup of very hot tap water at the ready.
    Coat a baking peel or rimless baking sheet with cornmeal. Carefully turn a few of the papo secos seam-side up and arrange them on the peel.

    Place the front edge of the peel at the back of the baking stone and quickly yank it toward you to shift the dough onto the baking stone. Repeat with the remaining papo secos. Quickly but carefully pour the hot water into the metal tray and immediately shut the oven door to trap the steam. Immediately reduce the heat to 425°F (218°C).

    ☞TESTER TIP: If your baking stone can’t fit all of the rolls, bake them in batches. As the Portuguese say, Não faz mal. No problem!
    Bake the papo secos until they’re puffed and golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove them from the oven and let them cool on a rack. To get that characteristic crusty outside, let the roll sit out several more hours prior to devouring.
