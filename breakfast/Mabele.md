* 1 cup fine Mabele meal

## Notes
* Hydrate 1 or 2 days ahead of time to ferment, i.e to make Ting pap (Ting ya Mabele).
* Cooking longer makes it taste better, but you may need more water (depending on how well the lid seals).
* If you cook with the lid off you need to raise the temp and stir continuously
* It is prone to cook over or burn if temp is too high
