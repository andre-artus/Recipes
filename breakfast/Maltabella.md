# Maltabella pap

## Ingredients (per person)
* 1/2 cup Maltabella
* 1/2 cup cold water
* 1 cup hot water
* 1/4 tsp salt

## Optional
* Butter, sugar honey to taste

## Directions
* Add cold water to pot
* Sprinkle Maltabella over water and leave to hydrate
* Stir in salt
* Add boiling water
* Bring to a slow boil and turn down to a simmer
* Cook at low temp with the lid on for > 15 min, stirring ocassionally (I use a whisk).

## Notes
* Cooking longer makes it taste better, but you may need more water (depending on how well the lid seals).
* If you cook with the lid off you need to raise the temp and stir continuously
* It is prone to cook over or burn if temp is too high
