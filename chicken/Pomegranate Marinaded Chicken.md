# Pomegranate Marinaded Chicken

## Ingredients

### Marinade
*	2 Medium Onion
*	6 Garlic Cloves
*	6 Tbsp Pomegranate Molasses
*	4 Tbsp lemon juice
*	4 Tsp salt
*	3/4 Tsp Black Pepper
*	1 Tsp Chilli Flakes


### Chicken
* 1.5 Kg thighs and drums or whole deboned

## Cook
1.	Blend all the marinade ingredients together in a blender until a well processed liquid forms
2.	Thoroughly massage the marinade into the chickens
3.	Allow them to marinate for a minimum of 1 hour but 3-12 is recommended
4.	Once marinated, remove them from the marinade, and scrape off any excess marinade
5.	Preheat your oven to it's hottest temperature (mine was 240c) with the grill/broiler on high and place your shelf as close to it as possible
6.	Place your chicken in a grilling basket, or on a wire rack, then place that within an oven tray and make sure the chicken is not touching the tray itself
7.	Put the tray in the oven with the underside of the chicken facing upwards, and cook it for about 8-10 minutes
8.	Remove it and flip the chicken over, so it is skin side up, then place back in the oven for around 6 minutes more
9.	Remove once the skin is crispy and browned, place on a flatbread to absorb any juices that run off.
