# Homestyle vanilla ice cream

## Ingredients

* 600ml full cream milk
* 6 large (800g) or 7 medium large (700g) egg yolks
* ¾ cup (155g) caster sugar
* 2 tsp vanilla extract or 1 fresh vanilla bean, split in half and seeds removed.
* 300ml thickened cream (35% milk fat)*

## Method

Heat milk in a heavy based, non-stick saucepan, stirring often until very hot and without boiling or scorching milk. Transfer to a jug or bowl with a lip and set aside.

Place egg yolks and sugar into mixer bowl and attach wire whisk. Mix on speed 2 for 1 minute or until thick and sugar has completely dissolved.

Gradually add hot milk and vanilla and mix until well combined. Transfer mixture back to saucepan. Stirring constantly, cook for about 8-10 minutes over a very low heat until mixture thickens and lightly coats back of wooden spoon or silicone spatula. Mixture must not boil or it will curdle, however it will be quite hot and a little steamy. Be patient with this step do not rush making the custard.

Return mixture to mixing bowl. Add cream and mix on speed 1 until thoroughly mixed. Remove bowl, cover and refrigerate until well chilled, about 6-8 hours.

Assemble drive assembly, freezer bowl and dasher (as per instruction book). Transfer chilled mixture to a jug with a pouring lip.

Turn mixture to speed 1, slowly add cooled custard to freezer bowl. Churn for approximately 20 minutes or until a very firm soft serve ice cream results.

Immediately remove ice cream to serving dishes or transfer to an airtight, sealed container and freeze for 4 hours or until frozen.

Remove ice cream for about 5 minutes before scooping. Homemade ice cream is harder than commercial ice cream so remove from freezer and allow to soften slightly.

Homemade ice cream is best eaten within 4-5 days and must be stored at -18C or in the coldest section of the freezer.
