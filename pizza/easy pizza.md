# Easy Home Pizza

Recipe is developed for acceptable results in a home oven.

## Ingredients (enough for 3 personal pizzas)

### Dough
* 250g bread flour
* 200g tepid water
* 1/2 tsp table salt
* a drop or two of honey
* 1/8 tsp instant yeast
* olive oil

### Sauce
* 1 Tbsp tomato paste
* 1 cup tomato passata 
* salt to taste (undersalt, as it becomes saltier as water evaporates)
* black pepper
* garlic (minced or flakes)
* onion (minced or flakes)
* 1 Tbsp olive oil
* Optional: balsamic vinegar and honey


## Directions

### Dough
1. disovle salt and honey in tepid water
2. add flour to large bowl and stir in dry yeast
3. stir water into flour until evenly hydrated, no need to knead
4. coat with a thin layer of olive oil
4. cover and let ferment for 1 hour at room temp.
5. place in fridge for next day (can store in fridge for several days, time = flavour)


### Sauce
1. Mix ingredients
2. cover and place in fridge for at least 30 min, or keep for next day
3. The sauce can be adjusted for sweetness or tartness with small amounts of vinegar and honey, keep in mind that the final sauce is concentrated by evaporation.


### Baking
1. Form the dough into 3 equal rounds (oil if necessary)
2. Place each round on a baking mat or baking paper, cover and leave to reach room temp.
3. Preheat oven to 230C (fan assist), or higher.
3. flour the tops of the round and press the rounds flat from the centre to the outside, moving the gasses to the outer crust. Pop any large thin bubbles.
4. Add a layer of sauce
5. Bake for 4-6min to firm up the base.
6. remove from oven, remove from baking mat and place on drying rack
7. add toppings
8. place pizza back in oven directly on the grate (or use a large SS cake rack for easier cleaning)
9. bake until crust has desired colour (6-8min depending on temp)

### Notes
* If you have toping that take longer to bake then add them in the first bake.
* Don't make the pizza too wet.
* Slice incredients thin enough so that they cook through, or precook.
* Small bars of cheese 0.5cm x 0.5cmx x 2cm seems to melt best given the time and temp I use.
* Salami siliced to 1mm works well for me, or I stack two on top  of each other if presliced.
* Bacon when raw does not always crisp up well enough, pan fry at low heat (about 4/9) until fat is translucent before adding to toppings.
* Leftover dough can be mixed into new dough to speed up flavour development.
