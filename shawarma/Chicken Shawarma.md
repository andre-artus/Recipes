## Ingredients
*	Pinch of saffron 
*	1 Medium Onion
*	1 Lime (zest + 20ml juice)
*	2 Tbsp Olive Oil
*	2 Tbsp Yoghurt
*	1 Tsp Salt
*	1/2 Tsp Black Pepper
*	1/4 Tsp Turmeric


## Directions
1.	Grind your saffron with 1/4 Tsp salt until it turns into a powder
2.	Add a couple tablespoons boiling water and dissolve the saffron powder
3.	Add the Yoghurt, spices to a bowl, then zest and juice the lime, and add both to the bowl
4.	Add the saffron water, oil, and the garlic (minced) then mix till smooth
5.	Slice and add the onion as well as your prepared chicken. Mix thoroughly until well coated
6.	Marinade for a minimum of 10 minutes, but at least 1h is recommended (for extra flavour) and up to 24h in the fridge

### To grill on skewers

1.   Remove excess marinade, then thread the meat onto skewers, folding it if necessary so it isn't dangling far from the skewer
2.   Add enough pieces for a portion, and take care not to compress them
3.   Suspend over a baking dish or oven tray, and place into your oven under the grill/broiler set to high
4.   Cook for about 10-12 minutes until the first side is browned, rotate and place back in the oven
5.   Cook for about 2-4 more minutes until the second side is browned (if your chicken is extra thick, you may need to cook this further)
