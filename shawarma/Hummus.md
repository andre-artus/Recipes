## Ingredients

### Hummus

* 8 ounces (227g) dried chickpeas (1 cup + 2 tbsp)
* 1 teaspoon baking soda, divided
* A generous ¾ cup (175-195g) good-quality tahini
* 6 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice, plus more to taste
* 3 garlic cloves, chopped (start with 1 clove if sensitive to garlic, adjust after blending)
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin, plus more to taste
* Kosher salt
* Freshly cracked black pepper, to taste
* 6 to 10 tablespoons ice water

### Fried Garlic-Lemon Topping (Optional)

* ⅓ cup (80 mL) good-quality extra virgin olive oil
* 5 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced
* 4 to 6 strips of lemon peel, about 2 inches long (avoid peeling too deeply to prevent bitterness)
* Flaky sea salt or kosher salt

### Other Topping Options

* 1 handful of flat-leaf parsley, chopped
* Paprika, sumac, or Aleppo pepper flakes

## Instructions

1. **Soak the chickpeas:**
   Add the chickpeas to a large bowl. Cover with cold water and ½ teaspoon baking soda. Soak for 8 hours or overnight. Drain and rinse.

2. **Cook the chickpeas:**
   Add the drained chickpeas to a medium saucepan with ½ teaspoon baking soda and 6 cups of water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cover the pot, reduce the heat as needed to maintain a rapid simmer, and cook for 30 minutes.
   Uncover the pot and add 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Continue cooking for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the chickpeas are very soft and smush when pressed with a spoon or fork, or between your fingers. Drain well.

3. **Blend the chickpeas:**
   Transfer the drained chickpeas to a food processor. Blend for 1-2 minutes until you have a smooth puree, scraping down the sides as needed.

4. **Add remaining ingredients:**
   To the food processor, add tahini, lemon juice, garlic, cumin, 1 heaping teaspoon kosher salt, and pepper to taste. Blend, and with the motor running, stream in the ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time. After 6 tablespoons of ice water, check the texture. If needed, add more water and continue blending until smooth and creamy. Taste and adjust seasonings, adding more salt, garlic, cumin, or lemon juice as needed.

5. **Make the topping (optional):**
   Heat the olive oil in a medium frying pan over medium heat. Once the oil is warm (not too hot), add the garlic and cook, stirring frequently, for 2 to 2½ minutes until the garlic just turns golden (don't let it brown).
   Add the lemon zest and cook for another 30 seconds. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the garlic and lemon zest to a plate and sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Reserve the oil.

6. **Serve:**
   Transfer the hummus to a large plate and use the back of a spoon to create waves or a well in the center. Spoon the garlic-lemon oil into the ridges or the well. Top with the fried garlic and lemon zest. Garnish with chopped parsley and a few shakes of paprika.
