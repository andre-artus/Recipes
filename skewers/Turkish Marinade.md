### To grill on skewers

1.   Remove excess marinade, then thread the meat onto skewers, folding it if necessary so it isn't dangling far from the skewer
2.   Add enough pieces for a portion, and take care not to compress them
3.   Suspend over a baking dish or oven tray, and place into your oven under the grill/broiler set to high
4.   Cook for about 10-12 minutes until the first side is browned, rotate and place back in the oven
5.   Cook for about 2-4 more minutes until the second side is browned (if your chicken is extra thick, you may need to cook this further)
