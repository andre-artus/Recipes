# Turkish Marinade

## Ingredients

* 1 Medium Onion
* 1/4 Cup Olive Oil
* 2 Tbsp Yoghurt
* 1 Tbsp Red Pepper Paste
* 1 Tbsp Tomato Puree
* 2 Garlic Cloves
* 1 Tsp Salt
* 1 Tsp Black Pepper
* 1/2 Tsp Cumin


## Directions
1.	Blend your onion into a fine paste, then squeeze the liquid out of it
2.	Add the onion juice, yoghurt, spices, pepper and tomato paste, garlic and oil to a bowl then mix thoroughly
3.	Add the chicken to the bowl, and mix thoroughly
4.	Marinade for a minimum of 10 minutes, but at least 1h is recommended (for extra flavour) and up to 24h in the fridge

### To grill on skewers

1.   Remove excess marinade, then thread the meat onto skewers, folding it if necessary so it isn't dangling far from the skewer
2.   Add enough pieces for a portion, and take care not to compress them
3.   Suspend over a baking dish or oven tray, and place into your oven under the grill/broiler set to high
4.   Cook for about 10-12 minutes until the first side is browned, rotate and place back in the oven
5.   Cook for about 2-4 more minutes until the second side is browned (if your chicken is extra thick, you may need to cook this further)
