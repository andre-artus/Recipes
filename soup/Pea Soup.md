Rinse well. By swirling the peas in water or stir with your hands.  Pour water off carefully. Small hole colander or strainer works. About 3x then its clean. Soak peas overnight or several hours in cold water.  Pour water off. Place in pressure cooker with about 2 inches of water above the water level. NEVER ever add salt. Then peas stay hard. Cook 20-30mins. low heat. Do onions leeks celery parsley as u do for veg soup. Not that much necessary. (only about handful when chopped.) However much u want to use. One to two potatoes and a carrot  cubed. Add to softened peas. Add salt pepper, 1-2 TBS tomato and Worcester sauce. Coriander about quarter teaspoon. only type of spice I use for this. Any herbs u like. All my condiments I eyeball according to the quantity of soup. U can add a bit of white wine too. You may want to only use half pkt of peas or even less. It swells up and makes a lot.
For smoky taste a small smoked hog or eisbein. This I add when I add veg. Or chopped bacon pre crisped which I add to end.  Cook over very low  heat for about an hour check half way and stir. Or stick in crockpot and cook for several hours. I actually will suggest if u cook a hog or eisbein to cook it first and add in as the meat can often be tough. Then your cooking time of the soup can be less.
